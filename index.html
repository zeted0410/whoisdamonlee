							<p>14/11/2023</p>
						</header><div class="content">
							<p>Damon Lee is currently in the sixth grade of elementary school and attends St. Joseph's Memorial School. He likes programming and fall guys, especially soccer. His specialties include stealing, threatening and beating, and he is one of the people everyone should emulate. He is Korean-Australian (is he?) and has yet to obtain a permanent residency. He has the status of a student now and has no problem with his credibility. His goal is to be good at studying, which means, nerd. He's not just a nerd, he's a real nerd. He is so good at math that Einstein is so smart that he says, "Damon Lee is smarter than me." But he's also handsome. He's literally the perfect guy.</p>

							<p>5/51/BC. 2989</p>
						</header><div class="content">
							<p>Damon Lee is a person who can really fly publicly. He can fly alone in the world, so he has two Guinness records. According to him, he reveals that he can fly by singing "Boy's a liar" when he flies. But he can do it because he's been practicing since he was 3,000 years old, the World Airborne Association claims. He's stealing with that ability, which is putting the world in trouble.</p>
